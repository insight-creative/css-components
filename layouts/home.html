        <h1>Hugo Recipes</h1>
        <p>Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of great <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a> resources out there, but it can be overwhelming as you figure out where to start. hugo.recipes is a collection of recipes that were either a struggle to find when starting with Hugo, or things that we often find ourselves searching for when working on client projects.</p>
